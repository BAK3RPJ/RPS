      <h1> A Round of Rock, Paper, Scissors with your Nemesis? </h1>
      <p id='info'> Rock, Paper, Scissors is a popular children's game often used to break ties, decide disagreements or settle stalemates.
        <ul> The game consists of the three named signs.<br><br>
          <li> Rock is made by making a fist, and loses to paper, while beating scissors.</li>
          <li> Paper is made by making a flat hand parallel to the ground, and loses to scissors while beating rock </li>
          <li> Scissors is made by making a fist while extending the fore finger and middle finger, and loses to rock, while beating paper.</li>
        </ul>
        The game is considered a zero sum game, because the winner can only do so at the other player's expense, and is a choice tie breaking mechanism as a result.<br>
        It is mentioned as far back as 200 BC during the Han dynasty in China, with many countries creating their own versions.<br>
